A simple lambda function for aws lex, that does api call to query a notion database and returns the json data.

I used this lambda function at one of my chat bot, who woul fetch phone number of MP (member of parliamnet) in Nepal, from a notion database.
On a separate code, an api call to house of representative fetches the MP and read pdf text find the matching phone number of MP and create a database in notion app.
